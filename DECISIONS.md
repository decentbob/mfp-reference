# Decisions

Resolved questions about the spec and this implementation. Decisions here
can be reopened — with a good reason — but reopening one should be done
knowingly, with the earlier reasoning in view, not by forgetting it was ever
decided. One entry per decision, newest first.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**Question:** what was ambiguous, contradictory, or wrong (quote the spec).
**Decision:** what was decided, and by whom.
**Spec change:** link to the issue/commit on the paper repo, or "none needed".

## 2026-08-19 — One framing rule, and the design rules it belongs to

**Question:** A whole-codebase review found that the commitment root was **not
injective**: `encodeSnapshot` wrote holder keys and backing names with `raw()`,
and adjacent unframed fields are ambiguous — a 31-byte and a 33-byte key
concatenate exactly like two 32-byte keys. Two different served states hashed
to one root, so an operator could equivocate with a single signature and no
provable fault, defeating invariant 22 precisely where the code claimed to
enforce it. Demonstrated with a working collision.

The same review found the codebase had no single rule for framing at all: some
sites length-prefixed, some wrote raw, some length-checked first. That
inconsistency was also the root of several accreted layers — encoders threw, so
`receiptProvenBy` needed a try/catch, so `Sequencer.submit` needed another one
translating `EncodingError` into `SequencerError`.

**Decision (Bob):** state the rule once and enforce it in one place.
`ByteWriter.fixed` / `ByteWriter.key32` assert width at the single point that
writes a fixed-width field; everything variable-length is length-prefixed.
Nothing is ever written raw. Honest output is byte-identical, so the slice-1
golden vectors are untouched — the change only rejects inputs that were never
representable.

The rule is written into CLAUDE.md alongside six others (one mechanism per
property; validate once at the owning boundary; copy in and copy out; verifiers
never throw; an error names the boundary that refused; domain tags in one
file). These are binding on future slices: a fix that adds a layer is a signal
that the layer below is in the wrong place.

**Consequences applied in the same pass:**

- `verifySignatureStrict` length-checks the public key. noble checks it outside
  its own try/catch, so an unchecked key made every verifier crash on hostile
  input. Length only — the small-order rejection is already inside the strict
  verify path, and repeating it cost a second point decompression per
  verification.
- `receiptProvenBy`, `verifyReceipt`, `verifyCommitment` and the new
  `stateProvesCommitment` return `false` on any malformed input.
- The UTF-8 decoder sets `ignoreBOM: true`. It was stripping a leading BOM, so
  `encode → decode` was not the identity and one backing could have two names.
- `Venue` is per operator (`latestFor`, `nextIndexFor`); a stranger's
  commitments can no longer be mistaken for the operator being checked, and the
  commitment index is derived from the record rather than sequencer memory, so
  a failed publish cannot make an honest operator sign two roots at one index.
- The backing name is a stored field computed once in `makeBacking`, replacing
  a `WeakMap` memo plus a bare warm-up call. `nameHex` is stored beside it, so
  the ledger and sequencer key registries on an immutable string.
- `NonceError extends LedgerError` lets the ledger say "this nonce is not your
  next" in its own voice, so the sequencer no longer pre-checks the nonce to
  relabel the error. A malformed operation now surfaces as `EncodingError`
  rather than being translated — it is one of the five named boundaries.
- `quantity.ts` folded into `bytes.ts` (quantity bounds are byte-encoding
  policy); domain tags moved to `contexts.ts`; the sequencer's duplicate
  registry of backings deleted in favour of the ledger's.

**Spec change:** none needed.

## 2026-08-18 — Slice 3 scoping: the transparent sequencer

**Question:** §C2 (sequencing) is large and mostly concerns the shielded and
Chaumian settings, dated instruments, revocation, and recovery. What is the
coherent transparent-only core, and how are the pieces the spec assumes
(a witnessing venue, the operator key in E) modelled?

**Decisions (Bob):**

- **Scope: the coherent core.** Witnessed indices, operator co-signed
  receipts, idempotent replay (inv 26), interval commitments over state
  (inv 22/23, transparent subset), and equivocation detection. Deferred to
  later slices: the recovery path — snapshot redemption and non-membership
  proofs (§C2b) — silence and non-service grades, key revocation, successor
  sequencers, dated instruments and standing lock requests, multi-sequencer
  transfers, and presentation/dishonour (§C3).

- **The venue is an in-memory append-only log with immediate finality.** The
  spec publishes commitments to "a widely-witnessed venue, typically a public
  chain", named with a finality rule. A reference implementation has no chain;
  `Venue` is the honest stand-in, with a seam where a real venue and its
  depth/gadget finality plug in later.

- **The commitment is over the whole served state.** Invariant 23's objects,
  transparent subset: per backing, its name, issued/burned totals, current
  balances, and the full operation log. Verifying a state against a commitment
  means being given that state and recomputing the root — the spec's
  availability point ("somebody has to serve" the trail). Per-element
  membership / non-membership proofs (the Merkle machinery) are deferred with
  the recovery path.

- **Idempotency is keyed by the operation hash.** A resubmission of the exact
  signed operation returns the identical prior receipt (inv 26). A different
  operation at an already-spent nonce is declined by the ledger's nonce
  rejection — the sequencer "refuses a second spend by declining to sign".

- **Operator-key validity is enforced at the sequencer boundary**, revisiting
  the slice-1 note that E's operator "carries no verification weight in the
  transparent core yet". `makeBacking` still validates the operator by length
  only (so the slice-1 canonical name format is untouched), but a `Sequencer`
  serves a backing only if E names a valid, non-small-order point equal to its
  own key. A backing naming a bogus operator is simply unsequenceable — the
  backer's setting, self-consistently.

**Spec change:** none needed — all are implementation stances within what the
paper leaves open for the transparent setting.

## 2026-08-18 — Transparent-slice scoping: nonces, replay, the operation log, and inv 7/26

**Question:** Slice 2 (the transparent claim layer) had to take several
positions the paper leaves to the sequencing and blinding slices, and a review
flagged three of them as deviating from CLAUDE.md's wording without a record.

**Decisions (Bob):**

- **Replay is a rejection, not idempotence (inv 26).** The ledger rejects a
  replayed message via a per-(signer, backing) nonce. Invariant 26's
  "identical prior response" needs the sequencer's request/response store and
  arrives with slice 3. Until then, replay is an error. Nonces are keyed per
  (signer, backing) — never a single global counter — so a stuck message on
  one backing cannot block the signer on another.

- **Inv 7 reads as issuance vs. movement here.** The transparent construction
  has issuance (backer-signed, raises outstanding) and movement
  (transfer/burn, holder-signed). Reissuance proper — the count-preserving
  denomination swap that needs no backer signature — is a blinding-era
  construction and is neither implemented nor tested in this slice.

- **The operation log records all three op kinds** (issue, transfer, burn),
  so the record is honest about what happened. But balances remain primary
  state, not a fold over the log, and there are no commitments over ledger
  state yet. Both — replayable state and commitments — arrive with the
  sequencer (slice 3). `position` is a per-backing append index, a stand-in
  for witnessed interval time.

**Spec change:** none needed — all three are implementation stances within
what the paper leaves open for the transparent setting. CLAUDE.md's inv 7 and
inv 26 bullets now point here.

## 2026-08-18 — A validated backing is frozen; raw key-byte mutation is unsupported

**Question:** `makeBacking` returns a branded, validated backing, but a review
showed its byte arrays stay mutable, so a caller could mutate a registered
backing and either brick its ledger state or (via `reliance.push`) forge a
signed name for invalid terms.

**Decision (Bob):** `makeBacking` freezes the backing object, its `reliance`
array, and each reliance entry, so structural mutation (`push`, property
reassignment) throws. `backingName` is memoized per object in a `WeakMap`, so
a backing's identity is fixed at construction and survives any later byte
mutation — a mutated backing still resolves to the state it registered.
Freezing a `Uint8Array`'s contents is not possible in JS, so mutating the raw
key bytes of a backing is unsupported behaviour, not a guarded error; every
trust boundary already copies bytes in, so this only affects a caller
mutating its own object.

**Spec change:** none needed.

## 2026-08-18 — Obligor keys are validated as non-small-order points, and verification is strict (non-ZIP215)

**Question:** `verifyBackingSignature` used noble's default `zip215: true`,
which skips the small-order-point check, and the encoder validated the
obligor key only by length. A review showed (and a runtime script confirmed)
that a backing whose obligor is the Ed25519 identity point accepts a
trivially forged signature over any name — invariant 2 is defeated by a key
nobody controls.

**Decision (Bob):** two independent guards. (1) `makeBacking` rejects an
obligor key that is not a valid, non-small-order Ed25519 point, at
construction and on decode. (2) `verifyBackingSignature` passes
`{ zip215: false }` for RFC 8032-style strict verification, which also
rejects non-canonical `R`/`S` encodings — relevant later for signature-keyed
idempotency (inv 26). The operator key in `E` is validated by length only for
now; it carries no verification weight in the transparent core yet.

**Spec change:** none needed — the paper does not mandate a verification
profile; this is an implementation obligation the paper leaves open. Recorded
here because it hardens invariant 2.

## 2026-08-18 — Signatures are over a domain-separated message, not the bare name

**Question:** CLAUDE.md states invariant 2 as "a valid signature by K over
its own name". The code actually signs `"mfp/backing-signature/v1" || name`.
A review flagged this as undocumented drift from the stated rule.

**Decision (Bob):** keep the domain separation — signing a bare 32-byte hash
invites cross-protocol signature reuse once other signature types exist
(swap authorization, issuance, holder release in invariants 26–27). The
context string is the pre-image's domain tag. CLAUDE.md's wording is
reconciled to say "over its own name, under a fixed domain-separation tag".
The name already commits to the format version (the version byte is inside
the hashed encoding), so the two do not drift; the context's own `v1` moves
only if the signing scheme itself changes.

**Spec change:** none needed.
