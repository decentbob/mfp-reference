# Decisions

Resolved questions about the spec and this implementation. Decisions here
can be reopened — with a good reason — but reopening one should be done
knowingly, with the earlier reasoning in view, not by forgetting it was ever
decided. One entry per decision, newest first.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
**Question:** what was ambiguous, contradictory, or wrong (quote the spec).
**Decision:** what was decided, and by whom.
**Spec change:** link to the issue/commit on the paper repo, or "none needed".

## 2026-08-18 — Transparent-slice scoping: nonces, replay, the operation log, and inv 7/26

**Question:** Slice 2 (the transparent claim layer) had to take several
positions the paper leaves to the sequencing and blinding slices, and a review
flagged three of them as deviating from CLAUDE.md's wording without a record.

**Decisions (Bob):**

- **Replay is a rejection, not idempotence (inv 26).** The ledger rejects a
  replayed message via a per-(signer, backing) nonce. Invariant 26's
  "identical prior response" needs the sequencer's request/response store and
  arrives with slice 3. Until then, replay is an error. Nonces are keyed per
  (signer, backing) — never a single global counter — so a stuck message on
  one backing cannot block the signer on another.

- **Inv 7 reads as issuance vs. movement here.** The transparent construction
  has issuance (backer-signed, raises outstanding) and movement
  (transfer/burn, holder-signed). Reissuance proper — the count-preserving
  denomination swap that needs no backer signature — is a blinding-era
  construction and is neither implemented nor tested in this slice.

- **The operation log records all three op kinds** (issue, transfer, burn),
  so the record is honest about what happened. But balances remain primary
  state, not a fold over the log, and there are no commitments over ledger
  state yet. Both — replayable state and commitments — arrive with the
  sequencer (slice 3). `position` is a per-backing append index, a stand-in
  for witnessed interval time.

**Spec change:** none needed — all three are implementation stances within
what the paper leaves open for the transparent setting. CLAUDE.md's inv 7 and
inv 26 bullets now point here.

## 2026-08-18 — A validated backing is frozen; raw key-byte mutation is unsupported

**Question:** `makeBacking` returns a branded, validated backing, but a review
showed its byte arrays stay mutable, so a caller could mutate a registered
backing and either brick its ledger state or (via `reliance.push`) forge a
signed name for invalid terms.

**Decision (Bob):** `makeBacking` freezes the backing object, its `reliance`
array, and each reliance entry, so structural mutation (`push`, property
reassignment) throws. `backingName` is memoized per object in a `WeakMap`, so
a backing's identity is fixed at construction and survives any later byte
mutation — a mutated backing still resolves to the state it registered.
Freezing a `Uint8Array`'s contents is not possible in JS, so mutating the raw
key bytes of a backing is unsupported behaviour, not a guarded error; every
trust boundary already copies bytes in, so this only affects a caller
mutating its own object.

**Spec change:** none needed.

## 2026-08-18 — Obligor keys are validated as non-small-order points, and verification is strict (non-ZIP215)

**Question:** `verifyBackingSignature` used noble's default `zip215: true`,
which skips the small-order-point check, and the encoder validated the
obligor key only by length. A review showed (and a runtime script confirmed)
that a backing whose obligor is the Ed25519 identity point accepts a
trivially forged signature over any name — invariant 2 is defeated by a key
nobody controls.

**Decision (Bob):** two independent guards. (1) `makeBacking` rejects an
obligor key that is not a valid, non-small-order Ed25519 point, at
construction and on decode. (2) `verifyBackingSignature` passes
`{ zip215: false }` for RFC 8032-style strict verification, which also
rejects non-canonical `R`/`S` encodings — relevant later for signature-keyed
idempotency (inv 26). The operator key in `E` is validated by length only for
now; it carries no verification weight in the transparent core yet.

**Spec change:** none needed — the paper does not mandate a verification
profile; this is an implementation obligation the paper leaves open. Recorded
here because it hardens invariant 2.

## 2026-08-18 — Signatures are over a domain-separated message, not the bare name

**Question:** CLAUDE.md states invariant 2 as "a valid signature by K over
its own name". The code actually signs `"mfp/backing-signature/v1" || name`.
A review flagged this as undocumented drift from the stated rule.

**Decision (Bob):** keep the domain separation — signing a bare 32-byte hash
invites cross-protocol signature reuse once other signature types exist
(swap authorization, issuance, holder release in invariants 26–27). The
context string is the pre-image's domain tag. CLAUDE.md's wording is
reconciled to say "over its own name, under a fixed domain-separation tag".
The name already commits to the format version (the version byte is inside
the hashed encoding), so the two do not drift; the context's own `v1` moves
only if the signing scheme itself changes.

**Spec change:** none needed.
